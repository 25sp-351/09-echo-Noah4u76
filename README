# Modular TCP Echo Server

To build the server, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the server and create an executable called `echo_server`.

## Running

To run the server with default settings:

```bash
./echo_server
```

To specify a port and enable verbose mode:

```bash
./echo_server -p 8080 -v
```

## Testing

You can test the server with telnet:

```bash
telnet localhost 2345
```

Then type messages and press Enter. You should see each line echoed back.

## Clean Up

To clean up the compiled files:

```bash
make clean
```

## Problems

I am not handling ctrl+c to close out the connection properly so it doesnt work. Im thinking I might have to timeout the socket for it to potentially check for a shutdown. Im not sure yet. I was researching into it.
